				<!-- <p>Hello, I'm Nick Murphy, a recent graduate of App Academy with a passion for technology and education.
					Prior to my transition into the tech industry, I worked as a high school math teacher for 2 and a
					half years, where I honed my skills in communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking.
					<br></br>
					During my time at App Academy, I gained valuable experience in software development, including
					full-stack web development using JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, SQL, Express, and Flask. I am
					excited to apply my skills and knowledge to a new role in the tech industry, where I can continue to
					learn, grow, and make a positive impact.
					<br></br>
					Aside from my technical expertise, I am a team player who is dedicated to collaboration and
					effective communication. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am always seeking out new
					challenges and opportunities to learn.
					<br></br>
					If you're interested in connecting or learning more about my experience, please feel free to reach
					out!

									<p id="bio">
										In the fall of 2022, I embarked on a new adventure by joining App Academy
										to become a full-stack software engineer.
										<br>
										<br>
										Leaving Blanchet was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made, but ultimately
										worthwhile as I set out to pursue my newest dream. This dream had been born out of multiple
										reasons: a passion for problem solving in a new environment, a need to develop a wider skill
										set that will allow me to work in remote locations, and a desire to test out my talent in
										design. Back in the summer of 2020 when I was in between teaching jobs, I had come across
										App Academy’s open curriculum and was immediately impressed by its thoroughness and level of
										engagement. I found myself quickly learning new programming languages and seeking out new
										coding challenges. Most importantly, as I kept coding I realized I was having fun. This
										experience left a lasting impression on me, and completing A/a’s program became a dream that
										one day I wanted to realize. Furthermore, all of my past experiences have taught me that no
										matter how challenging it might be, any dream is always worth pursuing.
										<br>
										<br>
										I am dedicating this next chapter of my life towards a new vision of my own future. If you’d
										like to reach out to me as I embark on this journey, feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact

										<h3>Bishop Blanchet High School: Go Bears!</h3>
									</a>
									<br>
									<h4 class="daterange">Mathematics Instructor, August 2020 - January 2022</h4>
									<br>
									<p id="bio">
										In the summer of 2020, I was able to turn hardship into opportunity upon arriving back home
										to
										live
										in Seattle for the first time in almost 9 years. Bishop Blanchet, a high school less than
										two
										miles
										away from the one I graduated from, gave me the opportunity to teach as a full time
										instructor.
										<br>
										<br>
										This was it, I had finally made it in my profession in the community I grew up in. Although
										the times were difficult due to the circumstances of online teaching, I felt like I had
										found a new strength being able to reconnect with students from the same background as me.
										Also even though the circumstances were like none I had ever faced before, I felt prepared
										as I had just come from an environment where I had to adapt to overcome adversity. During my
										year and a half at Blanchet I was able to guide students through courses in geometry and
										calculus, and make connections with students in place of the interactions they would
										normally have in a school environment. Also as an assistant coach for track and cross
										country, I had the pleasure of being a part of a boy's team that won four straight league
										titles (and counting) and one state title. I also helped bring back the school's chess club
										upon returning to in person learning, which helped me form even stronger connections with
										the student body I served. After so many years away from home, and in a time where I was
										around so many unfamiliar faces, I was more than happy to be welcomed back to my home area
										and give back to the community that had raised me into the person I am today. Thank you
										Blanchet, go Bears!

										<h3>Quantum Scholars: Teach in England</h3>
									</a>
									<br>
									<h4 class="daterange">Mathematics Instructor, September 2019 - May 2020</h4>
									<br>
									<p id="bio">
										With my studies behind me and a desire to keep adventuring, landing a teaching job in
										England
										through the Quantum Scholars program was another once in a lifetime opportunity. Throughout
										all
										of
										college I had worked to become a teacher, and that work was finally taking me places I had
										never
										imagined traveling to.
										<br>
										<br>
										While the nine months I spent teaching just outside of London still feel like a dream, I
										cherish
										my
										experience during that time. This is because of the obstacles that I faced, and how I
										responded
										to
										the adversity of those times. The biggest obstacle faced was learning how to work through
										imposter
										syndrome from day 1. Although I had experienced the teacher's life during my studies, I
										quickly
										realized how much of my teaching strength had come from my ability to connect with students
										through
										having a shared background. In the UK, this strength became my biggest obstacle.
										Furthermore,
										having
										just come from the ruggedness of a cross country bike trip less than a week before the first
										day
										of
										school, adjusting to the formalities of the British classroom felt like being an alien from
										a
										different planet. Despite this challenge, I gave all of my energy each day to be the best
										teacher I
										could and made positive connections with each of my coworkers who did the same. From them, I
										learned
										what it truly meant to be dedicated to a craft, and over time I improved my ability to work
										with
										them as part of a team and how to operate in a school system that was completely foreign to
										me.
										<br>
										<br>
										Although my experience was cut short by COVID, I will never forget the connections made in
										the
										UK.
										This experience teaching in another country has given me the confidence to succeed in any
										situation.

									</a>
									<br>
									<h4 class="daterange">NUS19 Rider, June 2019 - August 2019</h4>
									<br>
									<p id="bio">
										Obsessed with adventure after college, I took it upon myself to continue exploring my
										passions
										to
										new lengths. After spending a couple of
										years of teaching in the local Bellingham community I embarked on a new adventure, Bike &
										Build.
										<br>
										<br>
										Biking across the U.S had always been in the back of my mind since hearing my grandparents
										talk
										about the past possibility of doing it in their youth. Learning about Bike & Build from a
										friend
										in
										college made me realize I had the opportunity to actually do it. Every year the organization
										had
										been gatherin young adults in service-oriented cycling trips to raise money and awareness
										for
										the
										affordable housing cause. Outside of having a passion for cycling, seeing the rise of
										homelessness
										in my local community motivated me to contribute to the cause of providing affordable
										housing to
										those in need. Two and half months of travel and 4,000 miles later, me and a group of twenty
										five
										other like minded and crazy individuals accomplished our goal and raised over $30,000
										dollars
										for AH
										organizations across the U.S.
										<br>
										<br>
										Apart from just increasing my lung capacity and giving my leg muscles a little more
										definition,
										Bike
										& Build helped me form lifetime friendships and gave me an unforgettable experience in
										community
										outreach. It was also the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.

									<h4 class="daterange">MIT in Secondary Education, earned 2017</h4>
									<br>
									<p id="bio">
										I am eternally grateful for the time I was able to spend at Western. The six years I spent
										during my
										undergrad and graduate studies fueled me to explore my passions, pushed me to expand,
										challenge,
										and
										adjust my worldview, and allowed me seek out my place in the world.
										<br>
										<br>
										My undergraduate studies is when I began to really explore my passions as I sought out
										direction
										in
										life. For the first time I explored various and diverse fields of study, competed as a
										varsity
										athlete on Western’s track and field and cycling team, and began to form the beginning of
										many
										meaningful connections that shaped my life after college. Out of everything though, the
										biggest
										gift
										I was given during this time was the opportunity to explore my love for problem solving.
										Through
										the
										courses I took in mathematics and also at Fairhaven college, I developed my ability to think
										critically and creatively throughout my studies. I found my love for learning more than
										ever,
										and I
										decided to spend my graduate studies learning how to share the gift of learning with others
										by
										becoming a teacher. My final year where I studied as a student teacher pushed me to work
										harder
										than
										ever before as I dedicated all of my energy towards helping my students become better
										problem
										solvers. Although the work was tireless during these years, the reward of seeing others
										succeed
										was
										incomparable.
										<br>
										<br>
										Western showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love of helping others, and surrounded
										me
										with
										an abundance of inspiring peers who have helped shape me into the person I am today.
